This project is a fruit of what we learned in our first year of computer science engineering , it combine Java and Operations research to solve the famous problem of 0-1 knapsack , we used in this program :
- CPLEX API provided by IBM for developpers .
- JAVAFX for the graphical user interface.
- JAVA to manipulate the results from the CPLEX API.
